### Hi there 👋

I'm Sal. I currently deploy software in healthcare during the day.

At night I'm working on **[Logseq AI Plugin](https://github.com/shovon/logseq-ai)**, a plugin for [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), a note taking app that features backlinking; an insanely useful feature that I rely on heavily.

When stuck, I just code on stuff. Recently I've developed a keen curiosity on cryptography, and so, I've been doing a lot of that.

Past open source projects that I worked on:

- **[go-eccfrog512ck2](https://github.com/shovon/go-eccfrog512ck2)**, a Go implementation of the EccFrog512ck2 Weierstrass curve family for elliptic curve cryptography
- **[Hyperguard](https://github.com/shovon/hyperguard)**, an elegant data validation library for TypeScript
- My blog: [blog.salrahman.com](https://blog.salrahman.com)

Me fiddling around with Raytracing in various languages here:

- [C](https://github.com/shovon/raytracing-c)
- [Rust](https://github.com/shovon/raytracing-rust)
- [C++](https://github.com/shovon/raytracing-cpp)
- [V](https://github.com/shovon/raytracing-vlang)
- [Go](https://github.com/shovon/raytracing-golang)
